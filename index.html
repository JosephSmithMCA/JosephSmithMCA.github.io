            <h1>A Little About Me</h1>

            <div class="prose">
                <p>My name is Joseph Smith. With the help of Mr. Andrew Stamps and Alex Cruz of Mississippi Coding Academy, I was able to start my journey into becoming a Junior Full-stack Developer. I am still learning everyday and can not wait to learn even more. Before becoming a Junior Developer, I was a phlebotomist. I have always liked technology and I finally get to pursue that passion from so long ago.</p> 
                <p>I have been married to my lovely wife since May 14, 2022. We have an aquatic child named Lapiz, who just so happens to live in a pineapple. Some of my hobbies include reading, collecting rocks, gaming, and playing D&D. I look forward to learning more from you all. Thank you for your time.</p>
